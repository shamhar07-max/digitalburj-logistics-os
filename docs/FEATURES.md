## Limits you should know about

- Integrations were verified against mock providers, not live services (see INTEGRATIONS.md). Credentials and provider approvals (Meta templates, ASP accreditation, bank WPS onboarding, Terminal49 plan) are yours to obtain.
- Supabase is a replica; the live database is SQLite (single server). MongoDB is not used.
- WPS SIF follows the common bank layout – confirm with your bank before first upload. Deductions are netted into the fixed component.
- Arabic translation covers navigation, buttons, statuses and field labels; free-text data, error messages and some long help texts stay in English. Printed documents are English with Arabic titles.
- No live customs-system integrations ship out of the box (Dubai Trade / Mirsal / ICP need your own registered API access); the gateway adapter accepts JSON.
- PDF engine is Chromium (included in the Docker image; set `CHROME_PATH` otherwise).
- Default passwords must be changed; set `APP_SECRET`.
